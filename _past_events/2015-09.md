description: "A tad last minute, but don't despair! Come join us at Irish Embassy to talk about all your favourite Mac and iOS topics. As you can imagine, there'll be plenty of speculation on what the September 9th event has in store: new phones? New Macbook updates? New and improved Apple TV?(Frank predicts Apple Pay in Canada. You've heard it here first, folks!)The management team is working hard behind the scenes to bring you a bigger and better CocoaHeads throughout the fall, so we hope to see you at Irish Embassy.Cheers!"
